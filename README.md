# hash-map
Two Hash Map Implementations: Seperate Chaining and Open Addressing 

An implementation of HashMap using Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing, and another with Seperate Chaining.
Seperate Chaining Methods and Functionality
  Class HashMap
    put
    resize_table
    table_load
    empty_buckets
    get
    contains_key
    remove
    get_keys_and_values
    clear
  find_mode

Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing
  Class HashMap
    put
    resize_table
    table_load
    empty_buckets
    get
    contains_key
    remove
    get_keys_and_values
    clear
    

Each implementation has basic tests for each method commented out in 'main'. It is recommended to test methods by uncommenting
each test one at a time.

Code Citation
Created for a Data Structures class: a6_include.py contains data structures used to implement the hash maps (linked lists and hash entries).
Both hash_map_oa.py and hash_map_sc.py contain starter code used for the assignment as well. Code provided by instructors contains 'DO NOT CHANGE THIS IN ANY
WAY" in the comment
